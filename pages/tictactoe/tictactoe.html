                    <p> My second project with p5 was a tic tac toe game with a twist. For this project I had as usual big plans and ambitions.I don't like feeling constrain from the beginning by the possibilities, I usually think big first and then I find compromises. I had a big dream of making it so that you could play against the computer and always lose, but I quickly realized that this was beyond my skills and time constraints. Instead, I decided to focus on the aesthetics and the message that I wanted to convey.

                    The message was clear: no matter how hard you try in capitalism, you always lose. I wanted to use art and design to give this message a stronger impact. To achieve this, I incorporated a chaos element into the game. I used a random number in every box to create different sizes and locations of lines inside every box, which represented the X in the tic tac toe. I also created a trippy effect for the circles to add to the chaos.
                    
                    At the beginning, I had planned to use a cricket grid, but it turned out to be too difficult to implement. So, I settled for a simpler grid, but I still spent a lot of time perfecting the aesthetics. Although I didn't end up making the game interactive, I am proud of the result and the message that it conveys</p>
