                        Hey there, I'm Luciana! I'm an interface designer who loves creating user experiences that are both functional and beautiful. I'm constantly drawing inspiration from the small details of everyday life that most people overlook, that seem mundane or ordinary and I'm passionate about learning more about what makes people tick.

                        I live with my two cats, who are my constant companion. When I'm not designing, I love exploring new places and trying new things. I consider myself a generalist. I'm always eager to take on new challenges and work on a variety of different projects. I believe that being a generalist allows me to bring a fresh perspective to each project I work on, and it keeps me constantly learning and growing as a designer.

                        One of my favorite things about design is the opportunity to collaborate with others. I love working with other creatives and collaborating to bring innovative ideas to life. Whether it's brainstorming a new concept or fine-tuning the details of a project, I thrive on the energy that comes from working with a team.

                        I took a course that was designed to teach me how to use code as a means of creative expression. In the course, I learned to use the p5.js library, as well as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create stunning art and visualizations.

                        Throughout the course, we worked on a variety of small projects that were both fun and challenging. I gained a deeper understanding of how to use data to create beautiful visualizations and art pieces.

                        I discovered that code can be a powerful tool for artistic expression, and my instructor helped me tap into that creative potential. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced coder, this course is a great opportunity to learn new skills and push your artistic boundaries.

                        If you're interested in exploring the intersection of code and art, I highly recommend this course. It's a fantastic way to develop your skills and unleash your creativity.

                        It was after visiting Refik Anadol's exhibition at KÃ¶nig Galerie in Berlin in 2021 that I became completely fascinated with the world of creative coding. What I found most interesting was that he was not the only artist behind those stunning creations. While he was the directive and center, he worked with a huge team of developers, graphic designers, interaction designers, sound designers, architects, generative designers, and more to bring his visions to life. Art was no longer just a painting made by some dude, but instead became something much bigger and more collective.

                        That visit stayed with me and sparked a deep interest in creative coding. However, as an adult with a million things to do and think about, I struggled to find the mental and time space to make it a priority. That was until I discovered this course this semester. It opened my eyes to the many possibilities of creative coding, such as using code to create stunning visualizations of data that are both art and facts, or exploring the depths of the human mind in psychology.
                        
                        While I am interested in both practical and more artistic approaches, I find the abstract, artsy, critical, and subconscious approach of creative coding to be the most intriguing. This course has given me the opportunity to catch up on what I missed and to finally dive into the exciting world of creative coding.

                        In the creative coding course that I took, I learned a wide range of skills and techniques that have greatly enhanced my coding abilities. I started by learning the p5.js library, which opened up a world of possibilities for creating stunning visualizations and interactive experiences. I discovered how to use data to drive my creations, which allowed me to create more meaningful and impactful projects.

                        One of the most valuable aspects of the course was learning how to debug my code, which was a technical skill that I found challenging in the past. I now feel much more confident in my ability to troubleshoot and fix issues in my code.

                        But it wasn't just technical skills that I gained in the course. I also learned about the incredible possibilities of creative coding and the power that it has to create beautiful and meaningful experiences. The course opened my eyes to the potential of using code as a means of artistic expression.

                        In addition to these creative and technical skills, I also went back to basics with CSS and gained a deeper understanding of some of the concepts that had previously been challenging for me. By learning the fundamentals of CSS, I gained a greater appreciation for the power of styling and how it can enhance the user experience.

                        Overall, the course was an incredible opportunity for me to learn and grow as a coder. I gained a range of valuable skills that have already started to impact my work in positive ways.

                    <p class="m-6">
                        After completing the creative coding course, I found myself particularly drawn to two topics: the use of randomness and chaos in code, and the power of data to drive creative experiences. These two areas of focus have captured my imagination and I am excited to dive deeper into them in order to create new and interesting pieces.

                        The use of randomness and chaos in creative coding is fascinating to me because it provides an opportunity to create unexpected and surprising experiences for the viewer. By introducing an element of unpredictability into my code, I can create pieces that are dynamic and unique with each interaction. I want to explore different techniques for generating chaos in my code, such as using algorithms to create fractal patterns or leveraging randomness to create unique visual effects.

                        On the other hand, the usage of data in creative coding is a powerful tool for creating experiences that are both informative and visually striking. By utilizing data in my creative projects, I can create meaningful and impactful pieces that are grounded in facts and figures. I'm excited to explore different ways to incorporate data into my code, such as through the use of APIs or data visualization libraries.

                        By exploring these two topics in more depth, I hope to create new and interesting pieces that push the boundaries of what's possible in creative coding. I believe that with these tools at my disposal, I can create experiences that are both beautiful and thought-provoking. I can't wait to see where my journey in creative coding takes me next!
