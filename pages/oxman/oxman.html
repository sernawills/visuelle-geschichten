          Architect and designer Neri Oxman is the Sony Corporation Career Development Professor and Associate Professor
          of Media Arts and Sciences at the MIT Media Lab, where she founded and directs the Mediated Matter research
          group. Her team conducts research at the intersection of computational design, digital fabrication, materials
          science and synthetic biology, and applies that knowledge to design across disciplines, media and scales—from
          the micro scale to the building scale. Oxman’s goal is to augment the relationship between built, natural, and
          biological environments by employing design principles inspired and engineered by Nature, and implementing
          them
          in the invention of novel design technologies. Areas of application include architectural design, product
          design, fashion design, as well as the design of new technologies for digital fabrication and construction.

          with the output of each serving as input for the others.

          <h2>Vespers III: Hybrid Living Materials (HLMs)</h2>
          <p> Using a method of interfacing a 3D digital design and printing platform with engineered bacteria, in such
            a way that programmable, replicable control of gene expression across the surface of 3D printed objects is
            achieved, Vespers was created. It is a collection of masks exploring what it means to design (with) life. A
            novel technology for the design and digital fabrication of adaptive and responsive interfaces.
            Imagine, for example, a wearable interface designed to guide ad-hoc antibiotic formation customized to fit
            the genetic makeup of its user; or, consider smart packaging or surface coatings devices that can detect
            contamination; finally, consider environmentally responsive architectural skins that can respond to, and
            adapt—in real time—to environmental cues. Research at the core of this project offers a new design space for
            biological augmentation across a wide breadth of application domains, leveraging resolution and scale. </p>

            <h2>Silk Pavillon</h2>
            <p>What are radically sustainable methods for knitting, making and building in the age of the Anthropocene?
              How can humankind and members of other species such as silkworms collaborate in the construction of
              objects,
              products, and buildings? Can we extract silk without boiling cocoons? Standing six meters tall and five
              meters wide, Silk Pavilion II offers insights into these questions by combining kinetic manufacturing with
              biological construction, uniting the built and the grown, fusing technology and biology.</p>

            <h2>Radiofungi: Biological Pigments for Radioprotection</h2>
            <p>A major concern for manned missions is space radiation. Ionizing radiation is known to pose both acute and
              chronic risks to many organisms, including humans. At this time, it is important to expand strategies for
              radiation protection, including utilizing new materials and fabrication methods that can withstand different
              forms of radiation. The Mediated Matter group is researching the synthesis of biological pigments, including
              melanins and carotenoids, for biocompatible radioprotection. Such pigments can be fabricated for a variety
              of applications, creating a new class of materials and coatings that can protect life on Earth, in deep
              space, and beyond. Certain bacteria and fungi show a remarkable ability to persist—and even thrive—in
              high-radiation environments. The discovery of fungi inhabiting the interior of the International Space
              Station and highly irradiated terrestrial sites has led to an interest in organisms like the fungus genus
              Aspergillus. Some of these organisms form biopolymer pigments such as carotenoids and melanins, which are
              thought to have an important role in the radioresistance of the organisms. </p>

          <h2>Aguahoja</h2>
          <p>Aguahoja is an exploration of nature’s design space. A collection of natural artifacts were digitally
            designed and robotically fabricated from the molecular components found in tree branches, insect
            exoskeletons, and our own bones. Here, we propose a novel water-based design approach and fabrication
            platform that enable tight integration between material synthesis, digital fabrication, and physical
            behavior, at scales that approach—and often match—those of natural ecologies. </p>
