                    <p>My first project using p5 was an exciting adventure. At first, I didn't know where to begin, but I quickly realized that the possibilities were endless. I experimented with different shapes, colors, and effects, trying to create something unique and interesting.

                    At first, I started with simple shapes and colors, trying to get a feel for how p5 works. Then, I started adding more complexity, experimenting with gradients, shadows, and other effects. I was surprised at how easy it was to create stunning visual effects using p5.
                    
                    One of the things I enjoyed most about the project was the sense of freedom it gave me. I could try out different ideas, and if something didn't work, I could easily undo it and start over. This made the creative process fun and enjoyable, and it encouraged me to keep trying new things.
                    
                    As I worked on the project, I discovered new features and techniques that I hadn't even thought of before. This allowed me to take my project in new and exciting directions, and it helped me to push the limits of what I thought was possible.
                    
                    In the end, I was really proud of the project that I had created. It was a true reflection of my creativity and my ability to use p5 to bring my ideas to life. I can't wait to see what other projects I can create using this powerful tool, and I look forward to exploring new techniques and ideas as I continue to develop my skills.</p>

                        For my project on day and night in p5, I initially created an algorithm that used conditionals to change the visual elements of the program. I used a ball to represent the sun and moon, and changed its position and color based on whether it was day or night. Additionally, I made the background change progressively to simulate the transition from day to night.

                        However, I found that the transitions between day and night were not as smooth as I wanted them to be. So, I decided to try a different approach and use transitions instead of conditionals. I also used

                <div class="vertical-centered-container w-40">
                    <p> My second project with p5 was a tic tac toe game with a twist. For this project I had as usual big plans and ambitions.I don't like feeling constrain from the beginning by the possibilities, I usually think big first and then I find compromises. I had a big dream of making it so that you could play against the computer and always lose, but I quickly realized that this was beyond my skills and time constraints. Instead, I decided to focus on the aesthetics and the message that I wanted to convey.

                    The message was clear: no matter how hard you try in capitalism, you always lose. I wanted to use art and design to give this message a stronger impact. To achieve this, I incorporated a chaos element into the game. I used a random number in every box to create different sizes and locations of lines inside every box, which represented the X in the tic tac toe. I also created a trippy effect for the circles to add to the chaos.
                    
                    At the beginning, I had planned to use a cricket grid, but it turned out to be too difficult to implement. So, I settled for a simpler grid, but I still spent a lot of time perfecting the aesthetics. Although I didn't end up making the game interactive, I am proud of the result and the message that it conveys</p>

                        For my next project, I decided to use a JSON file to create data visualizations. I was interested in exploring forest coverage and used two data sets to create my visualizaton. The first data set included the percentage of forest coverage for each country, while the second data set provided the coordinates for each country.

                        To make the data more accessible, I merged the two data sets so that each country was assigned to a set of coordinates. My goal was to create an abstract map that would allow viewers to visualize forest loss over the years.
                        
                        To achieve this, I decided to use circles without fill to represent each country. The filling within the circles would then represent the forest coverage. I also made the visualization interactive, so that viewers could see the changes for themselves.
                        
                        After I completed the project, I was surprised by some of the findings. One of the most interesting things I noticed was that the forest coverage had been increasing in the global north while decreasing in the global south. I also experimented with adding Perlin noise to the circles to make the interaction smoother, but it didn't have the effect I was looking for.
                        
                        Overall, this project was a great learning experience. I gained a better understanding of data visualization and was able to convey a powerful message about forest coverage and global trends.

                        Perlin Noise is an amazing tool that allows you to create stunning visual effects, and for my latest project, I decided to explore the potential of this technology in the realm of emotional well-being.

                        The project is a collective art installation that aims to represent people's brain waves that are responsible for mood. I wanted to create a visual representation of this, to show that even when we feel alone or lost, we are not alone in the way we feel. I wanted to create a tool for collective healing and emotional growth.
                        
                        The idea was to create a live feed of brain wave data that could be translated into visual art, so that visitors to the installation could see a real-time representation of the collective emotional state of the group. To do this, I used a headset that monitors the wearer's brain waves, and then used Perlin Noise to create a visual representation of that data.
                        
                        The end result is a stunning visual display that captures the ebb and flow of collective mood in real-time. The visual effect is a constantly evolving, fluid landscape that shifts and changes with the mood of the group. By creating this installation, I wanted to create a sense of community and connectedness, to show that we are all in this together.
                        
                        The process of creating this installation was incredibly challenging, but also deeply rewarding. I had to learn how to use new technology, and I had to experiment with different techniques to get the desired effect. But in the end, it was all worth it. Seeing the final result, and watching people interact with it, was a truly magical experience.
                        
                        Overall, I believe that this project has the potential to make a real difference in the world. By creating a visual representation of collective emotional states, we can start to build a greater sense of community and empathy, and create a more connected and caring world.

                The idea is to create a knitting instalation under a bridge. The patterns of the knitting instalation are gonna be the waves of the brains of people walking under it. The result is going to be showing up on top of the underside of the bridge. The wool is going to be reused constantly to be able to keep it dynamic. How are the waves of people gonna be meassured? With sensors on top of the under side of the bridge (probably doesn't exist). Thanks to the perlin noise we can create smooth waves. Probably the knitting installation is only going to be able to show certain amount of people's waves at the same time (same as my algorithm so far, otherwise it collapses).
